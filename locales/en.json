I didn't buy any ointments or pills, I immediately turned to Anna. Everything is fine now! I recommend everyone who is not yet familiar with osteopathy to come to Anna for an appointment.",

Anna put my pelvis and ribs back in place after pregnancy (the ribs on one side, where the baby's bottom was during pregnancy, stuck out 2 cm higher than the other side). I feel light again now! Anna also adjusted my child's skull sutures as there was strong pressure during childbirth and one part of the skull overlapped the other, corrected torticollis and removed excessive tone in one arm. Everything else needs to be reinforced with exercises and massage. I needed one session, and my child needed 2. The child feels calmer and sleeps better 💖. I will definitely come back when I'm in Poland! Thank you 🙏",

The steel hoop that squeezed my ribs even with a small breath disappeared, and I finally breathe fully 🥹\n\nThe session itself was very gentle, no discomfort or pain, it felt like you were just stroked and lightly massaged, but don't be fooled 😁 a day later such muscle soreness appears that it becomes obvious which deep muscles/ligaments were involved that hadn't worked in years.\n\nAnna is very attentive, polite, pleasant, modest girl, which is very important for me — with medical education.\n\nI recommend everyone to visit Anna at least once, this is, without exaggeration, a different quality of life.\n\nThank you so much 🫶",
