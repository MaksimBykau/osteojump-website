I didn't buy any ointments or pills, I immediately turned to Anna. Everything is fine now! I recommend everyone who is not yet familiar with osteopathy to come to Anna for an appointment.",

Anna put my pelvis and ribs back in place after pregnancy (the ribs on one side, where the baby's bottom was during pregnancy, stuck out 2 cm higher than the other side). I feel light again now! Anna also adjusted my child's skull sutures as there was strong pressure during childbirth and one part of the skull overlapped the other, corrected torticollis and removed excessive tone in one arm. Everything else needs to be reinforced with exercises and massage. I needed one session, and my child needed 2. The child feels calmer and sleeps better 💖. I will definitely come back when I'm in Poland! Thank you 🙏",

        "motivation_text5": "Osteopathy gave me this opportunity. Here I can take my time. I can see the whole person — their history, their body, their needs. I can work without templates, choosing what is right specifically for you.",
