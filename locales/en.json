The first time was for my persistent back pain at that time. After the second session it became easier, after the fourth I forgot what a sore back was. Recently there was a problem with my neck. I didn't buy any ointments or pills, I immediately turned to Anna. Everything is fine now! I recommend everyone who is not yet familiar with osteopathy to come to Anna for an appointment.",

Anna put my pelvis and ribs back in place after pregnancy (the ribs on one side, where the baby's bottom was during pregnancy, stuck out 2 cm higher than the other side). I feel light again now! Anna also adjusted my child's skull sutures as there was strong pressure during childbirth and one part of the skull overlapped the other, corrected torticollis and removed excessive tone in one arm. Everything else needs to be reinforced with exercises and massage. I needed one session, and my child needed 2. The child feels calmer and sleeps better 💖. I will definitely come back when I'm in Poland! Thank you 🙏",

        "journey_text1": "My path into medicine began with midwifery. Working in a maternity hospital, I saw every day how babies are born — and how differently it can happen. That is when I began to understand how important what happens to a baby's body in the first minutes and days of life is.",
        "journey_text2": "Later I received my degree as a laboratory diagnostics doctor from Belarusian State Medical University. But I wanted to work with people directly — to help with my hands, not just with test results.",
        "journey_text3": "Everything changed when I discovered osteopathy. I was impressed by how gentle techniques can produce such results. Since 2018, I have been practicing osteopathy, constantly learning and improving.",

        "motivation_text2": "But sometimes I wanted more. Not because the system is bad — it is simply designed for a different scale. When you have hundreds of patients, it is difficult to give each one as much attention as you would like. It is no one's fault — just reality.",
        "motivation_text3": "Working in a maternity hospital, I saw how differently births can go. I saw babies who struggled in the first days. I saw mothers who needed support. And I often felt: I want to help more than the framework I am in allows.",
        "motivation_text4": "When I became a mother myself, this feeling only intensified. I understood how important it is for someone to look at you — specifically at you, not at a diagnosis or protocol.",
        "motivation_text5": "Osteopathy gave me this opportunity. Here I can take my time. I can see the whole person — their history, their body, their needs. I can work without templates, choosing what is right specifically for you.",
        "motivation_conclusion": "This is not a rejection of medicine — it is its continuation. Just in a different, more personal format.",
        "approach_title_main": "How a Session Works",
        "approach_text1": "Every session begins with a conversation. It is important for me to understand your history, complaints, and lifestyle. Then comes hands-on diagnosis: I assess tissue mobility, looking for tensions and restrictions.",
        "approach_text2": "I work gently. I use cranial, visceral, and structural techniques — depending on what you specifically need. My goal is not to force the body, but to help it restore balance.",
        "approach_text3": "After the session, I explain what I found and what you can do at home to maintain the results.",
