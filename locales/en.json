I didn't buy any ointments or pills, I immediately turned to Anna. Everything is fine now! I recommend everyone who is not yet familiar with osteopathy to come to Anna for an appointment.",

Anna put my pelvis and ribs back in place after pregnancy (the ribs on one side, where the baby's bottom was during pregnancy, stuck out 2 cm higher than the other side). I feel light again now! Anna also adjusted my child's skull sutures as there was strong pressure during childbirth and one part of the skull overlapped the other, corrected torticollis and removed excessive tone in one arm. Everything else needs to be reinforced with exercises and massage. I needed one session, and my child needed 2. The child feels calmer and sleeps better 💖. I will definitely come back when I'm in Poland! Thank you 🙏",

The steel hoop that squeezed my ribs even with a small breath disappeared, and I finally breathe fully 🥹\n\nThe session itself was very gentle, no discomfort or pain, it felt like you were just stroked and lightly massaged, but don't be fooled 😁 a day later such muscle soreness appears that it becomes obvious which deep muscles/ligaments were involved that hadn't worked in years.\n\nAnna is very attentive, polite, pleasant, modest girl, which is very important for me — with medical education.\n\nI recommend everyone to visit Anna at least once, this is, without exaggeration, a different quality of life.\n\nThank you so much 🫶",

        "hero_subtitle": "Answers to common questions about osteopathy",
        "q1_title": "How does a session work?",
        "q1_answer": "The session begins with a conversation and medical history, followed by hands-on diagnostics and gentle osteopathic work. Sessions last 45-60 minutes for adults and 30-45 minutes for children.",
        "q1_link": "Learn more about sessions",
        "q2_title": "What is osteopathy?",
        "q2_answer": "Osteopathy is a method of manual diagnostics and treatment based on understanding the interconnections of all body structures. An osteopath works with muscles, fascia, organs, skull bones, and spine, helping the body restore its natural balance.",
        "q2_link": "Learn more about osteopathy",
        "osteo_vs_manual_title": "How does osteopathy differ from manual therapy?",
        "osteo_vs_manual_answer": "Manual therapy focuses on a specific area of pain, such as joints or the spine. Osteopathy looks for the root cause and works holistically — with fascia, internal organs and the craniosacral system. Both methods complement each other well.",
        "osteo_vs_manual_link": "Read the comparison of osteopathy and manual therapy →",
        "osteo_vs_massage_title": "How does osteopathy differ from therapeutic massage?",

        "osteo_vs_massage_link": "Read the comparison of osteopathy and therapeutic massage →",
        "osteo_vs_physio_title": "How does osteopathy differ from physiotherapy?",
        "osteo_vs_physio_answer": "Physiotherapy is a broad field — exercise therapy, electrotherapy, ultrasound, manual techniques. Osteopathy always works exclusively with the hands and always takes a holistic approach — we look for the cause, not just treat the symptom. The methods complement each other well.",
        "osteo_vs_physio_link": "Read the comparison of osteopathy and physiotherapy →",
        "osteo_vs_chiro_title": "How does an osteopath differ from a chiropractor?",
        "osteo_vs_chiro_answer": "A chiropractor uses rapid spinal manipulations with a characteristic cracking sound. An osteopath works with gentle techniques — no sudden movements — and views the body as a whole, not just the spine. Osteopathic techniques are safe for children, pregnant women, and elderly patients.",
        "osteo_vs_chiro_link": "Read the comparison of an osteopath and a chiropractor →",
        "q3_title": "What does it feel like during a session?",
        "q3_answer": "The sensations are gentle and pleasant — light pressure, relaxation, sometimes warmth. Work is done delicately, responding to your body. The techniques are so gentle they're suitable even for newborns and pregnant women.",
        "q4_title": "How many sessions are needed?",
        "q4_answer": "It depends on your problem and health condition. Often improvement is felt after the first session. For lasting results, 3-5 sessions with 1-2 week intervals are usually recommended.",
        "q5_title": "What should I wear?",
        "q5_answer": "Comfortable clothes that do not restrict movement. A cotton t-shirt and light pants or leggings work well. Work is done with clothes on, no need to undress.",
        "q6_title": "Can children be treated?",
        "q6_answer": "Yes, osteopathy is safe for children of any age, including newborns. Children's techniques are even gentler and adapted to the characteristics of a growing body.",

        "q7_answer": "You can book through Booksy, WhatsApp, or by calling. The 'Book Appointment' button is at the bottom of the page.",
        "q8_title": "What's the difference between a consultation and a full session?",
        "q8_answer": "A consultation (20 min) is an introduction. We'll discuss your concerns, I'll do an initial assessment, and explain how I can help. It's perfect if you're unsure or want to understand if osteopathy is right for you. A full session (55 min) is complete bodywork: detailed diagnostics and osteopathic treatment.",

        "anxiety_title": "Are sessions safe for anxiety and panic attacks?",

        "content": "<h2>What is manual therapy?</h2><p>Manual therapy is a broad term covering various hands-on treatment techniques — joint mobilisations, spinal manipulations, soft tissue techniques. From the outside, a visit to a manual therapist and an osteopath may look similar: both work with their hands, searching for sources of pain and movement restrictions.</p><p>However, there are significant differences between these methods — both in diagnostic approach and in the scope of bodywork.</p><h2>How does a manual therapist work?</h2><p>Manual therapy usually focuses on the specific area of the problem — for example, the cervical spine or a painful joint. The therapist applies mobilisations, manipulations and muscle relaxation techniques to restore mobility and reduce pain in that area.</p><h2>How does an osteopath work?</h2><p>Osteopathy goes far beyond work with the musculoskeletal system. An osteopath:</p><ul><li>Looks for the <strong>root cause</strong> of the problem, which is often far from the site of pain</li><li>Works with <strong>fascia</strong> — connective tissue that surrounds and connects all body structures</li><li>Uses <strong>visceral techniques</strong> — gentle work with internal organs that can affect posture and mobility</li><li>Applies <strong>craniosacral therapy</strong> — subtle work with the skull and sacrum, regulating tension throughout the body</li></ul><p>The osteopathic approach is always <strong>holistic</strong>: rather than treating individual symptoms, the osteopath assesses the body as an integrated system and looks for patterns leading to complaints.</p><h2>Gentle techniques — safe for everyone</h2><p>Osteopathy does not use sudden movements or joint cracking. The techniques are gentle and delicate, making them suitable for:</p><ul><li><strong>Infants</strong> and small children</li><li><strong>Pregnant women</strong> — at every stage</li><li><strong>Elderly patients</strong> with sensitive tissues</li><li><strong>Post-injury patients</strong> requiring a cautious approach</li></ul><h2>When to choose manual therapy?</h2><p>Manual therapy works well when:</p><ul><li>You have a <strong>clear diagnosis</strong> — e.g. a cervical blockage or limited mobility after an injury</li><li>The problem is <strong>localised</strong> — affecting a specific joint or muscle group</li><li>You need <strong>post-surgical rehabilitation</strong> — e.g. after knee arthroscopy</li></ul><h2>When to choose an osteopath?</h2><p>Osteopathy can particularly help when:</p><ul><li>The <strong>cause of pain is unclear</strong> — tests show no problems, but symptoms persist</li><li><strong>Local treatment doesn't provide lasting relief</strong> — e.g. knee pain returns despite treating the joint alone, because the problem lies in the hip or pelvis; neck tension eases after mobilisation but returns within days, because the source is diaphragm tension</li><li>You have <strong>several complaints at once</strong> — headache, neck tension and digestive problems may have a common cause</li><li>Complaints are <strong>functional</strong> in nature — e.g. infant colic, sleep disorders, concentration problems</li><li>You're looking for care <strong>during pregnancy, postpartum or for a child</strong> — osteopathy offers safe, gentle techniques adapted to sensitive patients</li></ul><h2>Methods that complement each other</h2><p>Manual therapy and osteopathy are not mutually exclusive — many people combine both approaches depending on their needs. Both manual rehabilitation and osteopathic therapy help in regaining health and wellbeing. The important thing is to find a specialist who accurately diagnoses the cause of the problem and selects the appropriate treatment.</p>",

        "content": "<h2>What is therapeutic massage?</h2><p>Therapeutic massage is work with muscles and soft tissues. The massage therapist warms, relaxes and kneads the muscles to relieve tension, improve circulation and help you relax. Classic back massage, spinal massage, neck and shoulder massage — these are types of massage targeting a specific area of the body.</p><p>Massage deals well with consequences — muscle tension, spasms, fatigue. But it doesn't always reach the cause of why those muscles keep tensing up again and again.</p><h2>How does an osteopath work?</h2><p>An osteopath also works with their hands, but their task is different — to find why the tension arose, not just remove it. For example:</p><ul><li>Back muscle tension may stem from problems in the <strong>fascia</strong> — connective tissue that links the entire body into one system</li><li>Lower back pain may be related to tension in <strong>internal organs</strong> — such as the intestines or kidneys</li><li>Tension headaches may come from disruptions in the <strong>craniosacral system</strong> — the skull and sacrum</li></ul><p>An osteopath assesses the body as a whole and works with the cause, not just the symptom.</p><h2>I know both approaches from the inside</h2><p>I hold certificates in classic and therapeutic massage — I completed this training before studying osteopathy. That's why I understand well how massage works and where its capabilities end. During a consultation, I can assess what would be more suitable for you.</p><h2>When to choose massage?</h2><p>Massage works well when:</p><ul><li>You want to <strong>relax and relieve tension</strong> after physical exertion or a stressful period</li><li>You're bothered by <strong>local stiffness</strong> — for example, a stiff neck after working at a computer</li><li>You want to <strong>improve circulation</strong> and overall wellbeing</li><li>You're looking for <strong>regular support</strong> — massage every 2-4 weeks helps maintain good condition</li></ul><h2>When to choose an osteopath?</h2><p>Osteopathy can help when:</p><ul><li><strong>Massage helps but only briefly</strong> — back tension eases for a few days after a session, then returns. This signals that the cause lies deeper than the muscles</li><li><strong>Back pain persists</strong> despite a series of massages — perhaps the source is not in the muscles but in fascia, internal organs or the pelvis</li><li>You have <strong>several complaints at once</strong> — back pain, headaches and digestive problems may have a common cause</li><li>Complaints are <strong>functional in nature</strong> — infant colic, sleep disorders, concentration problems in a child</li><li>You're looking for help <strong>during pregnancy, postpartum or for a child</strong> — osteopathy offers gentle, safe techniques</li></ul><h2>Methods that complement each other</h2><p>Massage and osteopathy don't compete — they work well together.

A physiotherapist draws on a wide range of tools: therapeutic exercises, electrotherapy, ultrasound, laser therapy, manual techniques, and kinesiotaping.</p><p>Typically, a physiotherapist works with a specific diagnosis and a referral from a doctor. A course of treatment may combine several methods and last weeks or months.</p><h2>How does an osteopath work?</h2><p>An osteopath works exclusively with the hands — no equipment, exercises, or additional tools. The task is to find where the mobility of tissues is restricted in the body, and restore it through gentle techniques.</p><p>The key difference lies in the diagnostic approach. An osteopath does not focus solely on the site of pain. If you have lower back pain, the cause may lie in restricted mobility of the internal organs, tension in the diaphragm, or even in the pelvic area. The osteopath looks for the root cause by assessing the body as a whole.</p><h2>What is the essential difference?</h2><p>Physiotherapy uses many methods and often focuses on a specific area — for example, strengthening the muscles around a damaged joint or reducing inflammation with ultrasound. This is particularly effective after surgery, fractures, and during rehabilitation.</p><p>Osteopathy always involves hands-on work and always takes a holistic approach.

        "content": "<h2>What is chiropractic?</h2><p>Chiropractic is a manual therapy method that focuses on the spine and joints. A chiropractor uses rapid, precise manipulations — short, forceful movements with a characteristic cracking sound — to restore the proper alignment of vertebrae and joints.</p><p>The central idea of chiropractic: when the vertebrae are correctly positioned, the nervous system functions properly and the body can heal itself. That is why spinal manipulation is the chiropractor's primary tool.</p><h2>How does an osteopath work?</h2><p>An osteopath also works with the hands, but the approach is broader. In addition to the spine and joints, an osteopath works with soft tissues, fascia, internal organs, and the craniosacral system (skull and sacrum).</p><p>Osteopathic techniques are gentle and fluid — no sudden movements, no cracking. An osteopath does not \"set\" a vertebra with a single thrust; instead, tissue mobility is gradually and gently restored, allowing the body itself to find the right alignment.</p><h2>What is the essential difference?</h2><p>Chiropractic focuses on the spine and joints, using rapid manipulations. This can be effective for acute blockages and restrictions.</p><p>Osteopathy views the body as a whole. If your back hurts, an osteopath will examine not only the spine, but also the internal organs, diaphragm, and pelvis — because the source of pain may be located far from the site of symptoms. The techniques are gentle, with no sudden movements.</p><p>Rapid spinal manipulations are not suitable for everyone. In certain conditions — osteoporosis, disc herniations, vascular problems in the neck — forceful movements require particular caution. Osteopathic techniques are gentle and adapt to the patient's condition, making them appropriate even in the most demanding cases.</p><h2>When is chiropractic appropriate?</h2><ul><li><strong>An acute spinal blockage</strong> — the feeling that something has \"seized up\"</li><li>You are already familiar with the method and <strong>it brings you relief</strong></li><li>You need <strong>focused work with a specific joint</strong> or vertebra</li></ul><h2>When is it better to choose an osteopath?</h2><ul><li>You prefer a <strong>gentle approach without sudden manipulations</strong> — especially if the characteristic cracking sound concerns you</li><li><strong>Pain keeps returning</strong> after spinal correction — if relief after an \"adjustment\" lasts only days or weeks and then everything repeats, this is a signal: the cause does not lie in the vertebra itself. An osteopath looks for why the vertebra \"shifts out\" — it may be due to tension in internal organs, fascia, or the pelvis</li><li>You need help <strong>during pregnancy or postpartum</strong> — gentle techniques are safe for both mother and baby</li><li>You are looking for a specialist <strong>for a child or infant</strong> — osteopathic techniques for children are exceptionally gentle</li><li>You have <strong>several complaints at once</strong> — back pain, headaches, digestive problems — an osteopath looks for the shared underlying cause</li></ul><h2>Safety and gentleness</h2><p>Gentle osteopathic techniques are suitable for patients of all ages — from newborns to the elderly.
